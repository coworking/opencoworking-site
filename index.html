<p>Open Coworking is an organization created of, by, and for members of
<a href="http://coworking.org">the global coworking community</a>.</p>

<p>Our goal is to facilitate and promote collaboration between coworking
communities around the world. We do this by supporting projects that
demonstrate and emphasize the core coworking values: collaboration, openness,
community, accessibility, and sustainability.
We know that the key to coworking's impact lies in the core values. As
coworking grows worldwide, we consider it our mission to keep the core values
in the conversation. </p>

<p>Open Coworking was established in early 2012. The first project we embarked
on was to assume responsibility for 
<a href="http://wiki.coworking.com">The Coworking Wiki</a>. We have a global
Coworking Map in the works, and in 2014 launched a series of
<a href="http://coworking.com/talks/">Coworking Talks</a>
that tap into each core value and highlights ways different spaces put them into
action.</p>

<!--<p>
If you would like to join or help out, there are many ways to participate.  The simplest way is to
<a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&#038;hosted_button_id=QR9UEDXPXUUUL">make a donation</a> or commit to contributing <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&#038;hosted_button_id=RGQWYCLFA4EDQ">$25 per month</a> or <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&#038;hosted_button_id=PFKT8G8LDZX7Q">$100 per year</a> so we have ongoing income to achieve our goals.
You can also contribute your time, or the time of a paid staff member in your space. We have many roles we need
to fill and are always looking for dedicated individuals looking for ways to connect with the greater community.
You can also donate a membership in your space that we can use to place someone in your city.  
Let us know and we'll get you setup on the team.

<p><h3>Open Coworking Is Now Searching for City Curators</h3></p>

<h4>What Does a City Curator Do?</h4>
<p>
A City Curator is a coworking trustee for his/her city. They curate and maintain a list of all coworking spaces in their city on the Open Coworking Map.
</p>

<p>
It takes about 2 hours to search for and collect the information for all of the city’s coworking spaces (such as their locations, contact info, and official websites). These 2 hours may seem a modest investment, but it is enough to make a substantial impact on your local community.
</p>

<p>
After this initial setup, we recommend checking the information accuracy of at least one of the coworking spaces per month to make sure that the list stays up-to-date. This takes about 5-10 minutes. Yep, that’s about it!
</p>

<h4>Who Is Qualified?</h4>
<p>
Because we’re looking for people who are personally invested in cultivating the idea of coworking, we’re open to City Curators being active members, employees, or owners of a coworking space within the city they’re representing for at least 6 months out of the year. An active Twitter account is also required, as this provides access to the Map project.
</p>

<h4>How Big of a Deal Is This?</h4>
<p>
It’s pretty big. Having an unpaid volunteer role may not usually be glamorous, but when 5 minutes a month bestows the title of City Curator upon you, it becomes a very valuable position. Plus, it sounds really good on a resume or in a first handshake introduction. Your name and title would be clearly displayed on the Open Coworking Map, Open Coworking website, and on the Coworking Wiki too.
</p>
<p>
Open Coworking is a non-profit that seeks to cultivate local coworking communities around the world while keeping the core values of coworking in the conversation. You’ll gain valuable experience in community relations, getting connected with each of your city’s coworking spaces and other City Curators from around the world. You’ll also have the pleasure of working with some of the longest-tenured members of the coworking movement, including Jacob Sayles, Ashley Proctor, Craig Baute, and others.
</p>

<p>
There is only one curator per city. Click here to fill out the application or email Oren Salomon with questions at oren@opencoworking.org.
